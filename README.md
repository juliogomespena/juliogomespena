# Hello, I'm Julio 👋
### Software Engineer | Problem Tackler

## About Me
I craft performance-minded .NET solutions that turn operational bottlenecks into smooth user experiences. 

At CODIT, I built an AI‑driven exception interpreter using Azure AI Foundry, fetching instructions from Blob Storage, securing secrets with Key Vault, and Entra ID for production authentication. Fully deployed via Bicep and gated with feature flags. A targeted cost analysis delivered ~96% LLM cost savings.

I also modernized backend components, adding resiliency policies to outbound HTTP calls and replacing exception‑driven logic with a Result pattern, backed by adjusted integration tests for a smooth transition. On the frontend, I handled React bug‑fixing and added unit/regression tests.

In past experiences, migrated a long-lived SOAP web service to modern .NET REST APIs while maintaining a proxy façade so existing request/response formats remained stable for customers integrations while the platform evolved. 

Alongside the migration, I’ve delivered integrations across the hospitality stack. Portuguese CIUS-PT, Polish and Colombian financial fiscalization services; Backend support for tourism-tax payments; XML configuration tool for notification clients; Phone centrals integrations and digital room-lock backend services.

Comfortable working across C# .NET, ASP.NET Core, Azure architecture and infrastructures, REST APIs, SQL and NoSQL, Continuous Integration and Continuous Development (Azure Devops and Github Actions), Azure Functions and Logic Apps, Entity Framework, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite and React.
